# loginForm-HTML-CSS-JS
This is the project I did in week 4 of the Academy.
1. This form is supposed to display correct login credentials (which in this current project I used mine).
2. Also included a link that take you to a page where you supposed to create an account if you do not have one.
3. This project is a combination of html, css, and js. This is still a beginner level.
